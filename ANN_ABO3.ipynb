    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook aims to replicate the studies that were successful in predicting the lattice constants of the Perovskite crystal ($ABO_{3}$). The papers preoduced the results with the model's error around 2%. It's important to identify the features neccessary to perform predictions. The lattice constants of the $ABO_{3}$ -type may be correlated compounds as a general function of nine variables as below\n",
    "\n",
    "$Lattice constant = f(z_A + z_B + z_O + r_A + r_B + r_O + x_A + x_B + x_O)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where z, r and x denote the valence, the radius and the electronegativity of the ions (A, B, O), respectively. It is noted that the three variables associated with anion $O^{2-}$ , namely $z_{O}, r_{O},$ and $x_{O}$ can be ignored as they remain unchanged for all of the samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lattice constant can be reduced as a ﬁve-parameter function shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$Lattice constant = f(z_A + r_A + r_B + x_A + x_B)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Goldschmidt’s tolerance factor (t) can condense the coation atomic radii into one expression. It has been widely accepted as a criterion for the formation of the perovskite structure, up to now. I will use $\\textbf{four features}$ including the tolerance factor and others are denoted by, $r_{A}, r_{B}$ and $\\frac{r_{A}}{t}$. The list of feature does not include electronegativity and valence number. Basically, other sets of features that includes these two atomic configurations can be used to predict the lattice constant with great accuracy. However, I will only take the atomic radii of the two cations in to my account. The tolerance factor (t) is expressed as below.\n",
    "\n",
    "$t = \\frac{r_A + r_O}{\\sqrt{2}(r_B + r_O)}$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Procedure\n",
    "First I will perform feature engineering. Next I will build the ANN (Hereafter called as ANN) model and also perform a GridSearch (GS). GS fine tunes the hyperparameters of the ANN. Finally I will perform the predictions from the model. The model will be prepared with the fine tuned hyperparameters. The GridSearch in the sklearn package convineintly provides the best model which can be used to fit and predict.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Feature engineering\n",
    "In the following section, the \".csv\" file is loaded into the program. The data is inspected for assurity. I observed the '.csv' provides the atomic radii for two atoms A and B in the crystal ($r_{A}$ and $r_{b}$), and the tolerance factor is absent. So the tolerance factor and $\\frac{r_{A}}{t}$ needs to be calculated. I have concanated them as columns in the following code."

Here, the artificial neural network comes to the rescue. ANNs performance is remarkable for regression model. ANN works for any kind of numerical system.\n",
